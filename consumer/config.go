	//:param Endpoint:
	//:param AccessKeyID:
	//:param AccessKeySecret:
	//:param SecurityToken: If you use sts token to consume data, you must make sure consumer will be stopped before this token expired.
	//:param CredentialsProvider: CredentialsProvider that providers credentials(AccessKeyID, AccessKeySecret, StsToken)
	//:param Project:
	//:param Logstore:
	//:param Query: Filter rules Corresponding rules must be set when consuming based on rules, such as *| where a = 'xxx'
	//:param ConsumerGroupName:
	//:param ConsumerName:
	//:param CursorPosition: This options is used for initialization, will be ignored once consumer group is created and each shard has beeen started to be consumed.
	//  Provide three options ：BEGIN_CURSOR,END_CURSOR,SPECIAL_TIMER_CURSOR,when you choose SPECIAL_TIMER_CURSOR, you have to set CursorStartTime parameter.
	//:param HeartbeatIntervalInSecond:
	// default 20, once a client doesn't report to server * HeartbeatTimeoutInSecond seconds,
	// server will consider it's offline and re-assign its task to another consumer.
	// don't set the heatbeat interval too small when the network badwidth or performance of consumtion is not so good.
	//:param DataFetchIntervalInMs: default 200(Millisecond), don't configure it too small (<100Millisecond)
	//:param HeartbeatTimeoutInSecond:
	// default HeartbeatIntervalInSecond * 3, once a client doesn't report to server HeartbeatTimeoutInSecond seconds,
	// server will consider it's offline and re-assign its task to another consumer.
	//:param MaxFetchLogGroupCount: default 1000, fetch size in each request, normally use default. maximum is 1000, could be lower. the lower the size the memory efficiency might be better.
	//:param CursorStartTime: Will be used when cursor_position when could be "begin", "end", "specific time format in time stamp", it's log receiving time. The unit of parameter is seconds.
	//:param InOrder:
	// 	default False, during consuption, when shard is splitted,
	// 	if need to consume the newly splitted shard after its parent shard (read-only) is finished consumption or not.
	// 	suggest keep it as False (don't care) until you have good reasion for it.
	//:param AllowLogLevel: default info,optional: debug,info,warn,error
	//:param LogFileName: Setting Log File Path，for example "/root/log/log_file.log",default
	//:param IsJsonType: Set whether the log output type is JSON，default false.
	//:param LogMaxSize: MaxSize is the maximum size in megabytes of the log file before it gets rotated. It defaults to 100 megabytes.
	//:param LogMaxBackups:
	// 	MaxBackups is the maximum number of old log files to retain.  The default
	// 	is to retain all old log files (though MaxAge may still cause them to get
	// 	deleted.)
	//:param LogCompass: Compress determines if the rotated log files should be compressed using gzip.
	//:param HTTPClient: custom http client for sending data to sls
	//:param AutoCommitDisabled: whether to disable commit checkpoint automatically, default is false, means auto commit checkpoint
	//	  Note that if you set autocommit to false, you must use InitConsumerWorkerWithCheckpointTracker instead of InitConsumerWorker
	//:param AutoCommitIntervalInSec: default auto commit interval, default is 30
	//:param AuthVersion: signature algorithm version, default is sls.AuthV1
	//:param Region: region of sls endpoint, eg. cn-hangzhou, region must be set if AuthVersion is sls.AuthV4
